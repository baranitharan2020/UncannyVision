How to use:
1. Create a bounding box in an image. This marks the start of the action.
2. Choose any action.
3. Create another bounding box in any succeeding image. This marks the end of the action.
4. Action is automatically chosen for the ending image.

Bugs:
1. Use "Delete Action" button to delete any annotation. Clear (C) doesn't work for that purpose.

How the information is stored:
Details of every different action is stored in a different text file.
File format: index_image-name_start-image-index_end-image-index.txt
The file stores the coordinates of the starting and ending image annotation.
